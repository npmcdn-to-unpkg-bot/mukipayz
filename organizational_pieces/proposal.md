Mukipayz
Jamie, Michael, & Daniel


Our product, Mukipayz, is a cost sharing application.  Mukipayz will function as a PayPal marketplace for peer to peer transactions. Forget about bothering the waitress to split the bill 6 ways or paying for dinner time and time again. With Mukipayz, expenses can be divided and shared amongst peer groups.
In order to take advantage of  Mukipayzâ€™s cost sharing platform, users must first create an account. At that point, the user can create expense sharing groups inviting other users. If the other users are not members of our site they are prompted to join via email.

We will be using various technologies including the PayPal API, Node.js, Express.js, Authorization and Authentication, SSL/HTTPS, OAuth, Flickity, Gulp, SASS, and GIT.
