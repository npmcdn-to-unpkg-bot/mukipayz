  When tasked with designing a quarter 2 project that encompassed creating and deploying a complete CRUD (create, read, update, delete) app, our group decided on a peer to peer cost sharing platform called Mukipayz.

  Mukipayz is a mobile application that allows for easy tracking, sharing, and paying of various group expenses
  How Mukipayz Works
  * A user lands at our landing page and if they are interested signs up/logs in
  * Users create groups with group names
  * Users invite friends and family to join their groups
  * Users upload bill information (cost, pictures, name of bill) to specific groups
  * Users control the timing and method of payments
  * Dwolla makes peer to peer payments easy
  * Alternatively if peers choose another method of payment users can still mark that they have paid their part of the bill.

Some Technology We Used
- Node.js
- Express.js
- knex
- Dwolla API
- Oauth
- Bootstrap
- Mailgun


As a group we felt that it was important to make a functioning application and also to launch it and make it live. By letting Dwolla handle the payments we were able to keep security top priority.
