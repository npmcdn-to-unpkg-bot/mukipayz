  When tasked with designing a quarter 2 project that encompassed creating and deploying a complete CRUD (create, read, update, delete) app, our group decided on a peer to peer cost sharing platform, Mukipayz.

  Mukipayz is an application that makes sharing expenses and costs easy.

  How Mukipayz Works
  * Users create groups
  * Users invite friends and family to join their groups
  * Users choose which bills/expenses to share with which group
  * Users control the timing and method of payments
  * Dwolla makes peer to peer payments easy

Some Technology We Used
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Dwolla API
- ????? ADD MORE

As a group we felt that it was important to make a functioning application and also to launch it and make it live. By letting Dwolla handle the payments we were able to keep security top priority.
